# CS-386-Project

## Basic Rules

Some quick rules for the repo so everything goes smoothly:
- We are pretending that master and test are **protected**, so that means **no direct pushing to master or test**. Make a new branch from test, push all of your changes and stuff to that new branch, then when you are finished, merge that new branch into *test*. At the end of the week or whenever everybody is done for the week, we will merge test into master.
- If you have work or think of work, go to the *Projects* tab and make an issue for said work. Read the first one I made to see how we are structuring issues. **Always** comment updates or descriptions and stuff before you close out the story. No need for anything long or fancy, just something easy and simple to know what was done.
- If you have any suggestions or opinions on the setup I made, please let me know, the most important thing is having a dev environment we like and understand.
