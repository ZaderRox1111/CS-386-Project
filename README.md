# CS-386-Project(QuikMafs)

QuikMafs is an easy-to-use online calculator for students that will include a matrix calculator, unit conversions, statistic calculations, and probability calculator. Our goal is to develop a calculator that will help students solve math problems and teach them. Every calculator will have step-by-step processes to guide the user on how to do the problem. Finally, QuikMafs will have an easy-to-understand and friendly UI.
