# Description
QuikMafs is a user-friendly multi purpose calculator that allows college students to easily compute/calculate math problems and understand how they are solved. By having a simple and easy to use UI, it allows students to complete calculations and operations easily. For our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) we design our interface to optimize the user’s experience. For our MVP functionality, we developed the Matrix page with one matrix that can calculate Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF). Once the user selects the operation and inputs the values into the matrix, there is a formatted output matrix. We also implemented a Statistics class that calculates union and intersection probabilities as well as combinations and permutations. Additionally, we added a conversion class length, time, mass and volume. We provided the link to our [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project).

# Validation
## Script and User Answers
- How do you compare the application to other multi use calculators like (symbolab and wolfram alpha)?
  1. User 1: It is easier to use than other multi use calculators but I prefer how the other calculators look. It’s very simple and fast at calculating the problems.
  2. User 2: The UI is a little lacking in color and styles when compared to Wolfram Alpha, but it is a lot easier to use.
  3. User 3: It seems more intuitive - I’d like to see more functionality added so it could approach the versatility of something like Wolfram.
  4. User 4: The calculator was very simple and easy to use although it wasn’t very colorful or nice looking. All the functions and calculators worked perfectly.

- How would you rate the UI out of 10?
  1. User 1: I would rate the UI 6/10, it’s functionally good but could have more design elements to make it aesthetically pleasing.  
  2. User 2: I would rate it a 4, it was bland and very simple. It is easy to navigate however with the few options and simple looks.
  3. User 3: The interface was simple but a bit boring - there were also a lot of windows opening and closing, which could’ve been made more simple. 5/10 but could easily be improved.
  4. User 4: I would rate the UI a 6/10, it was very simple however it was boring looking and need to have some color and designs.

- What else would you like to see on QuikMafs?
  1. User 1: I would like to see derivatives and integrals on this application because I use them a lot for my math and physics classes.
  2. User 2: I would probably like to see some more colors and some more calculations on the matrix. Perhaps matrix multiplication or eigenvalues or something extra.
  3. User 3: Calculus-related operations like derivatives and integrals would be nice. Also, the ability to do more stuff with matrices besides just RREF.
  4. User 4: I would like to see an updated UI and more calculators, especially derivatives and integrals since they can be very hard to do sometimes.

- Have the user go through the matrix calculator for their homework.
  1. User 1 Feedback: The output displayed super fast which is great but the output could be bigger and the format of the numbers could be improved.
  2. User 2: Really easy to make the matrix larger or smaller, and the result was fast. The way the result looks was not my favorite though, so that could definitely be improved.
  3. User 3: Very intuitive and quick - exactly what I would need for an assignment.
  4. User 4: The matrix calculator was very easy to use and fast. I could easily get a 100 on my homework!

- Have the user calculate conversions for their homework.
  1. User 1 feedback: I really liked the drop down menu for the different length conversions. It made it easy to use and find the conversions I needed. It could also have a feature where you start to type what conversion you want and then the program displays the options that match. 
  2. User 2: I like how it prevents you from converting to other types, but that could have been solved as well with a third dropdown that selects length/time/etc. It would’ve made the list a lot smaller too so I could’ve gone through faster.
  3. User 3: I like how many conversion options there are - it would be cool to have a way to add more, as an extension or something.
  4. User 4: The conversions were very nice and easy to understand. It was cool that it auto sorted the conversion based on what unit you picked first. For example if I picked meters it automatically sorted the next column to length measurements.

- Have the user use the probability functions for their homework.
  1. User 1 feedback: The probability functions were easy to use and the output was fast. It would be cool if the names of the functions were displayed as well as the symbol because it might be difficult for some users to remember the symbol. 
  2. User 2: I’m not sure how useful this one is, the options are very limited and aren’t very useful except for super simple calculations that google can do.
  3. User 3: This one seems a little obscure. I’m sure it’s useful for someone who knows about it, but I’d like to see it explained a bit better.
  4. User 4: I don’t use probability much however these calculations could help someone who needs to do probability.

## Results
We think the features that worked well were the Matrix calculator and the conversions. Our users liked how fast the output displayed. They also liked the drop down menu for the conversions UI. We received some good feedback from the users as well. They thought the output could be formatted more so it’s easier to read and look at. The learning curve of our system is shallow, the users thought the design was intuitive and quick to produce output. They also enjoyed how easy to understand and simple the UI is, even if it is a little bland.

## Reflections
After talking to a few users we realized that there are still plenty of things that we would need to implement to make it true to our value propositions. A UI that is a little more fleshed out, and some more matrix calculations would definitely be nice, however we completed enough to get a simple Proof of Concept done - so we know where to go in the future.
