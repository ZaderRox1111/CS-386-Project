Use-Case: User - Conversions
1. The user interacts with the interface to convert numbers from one unit system to another.
2. The only actor present is the user.
3. Preconditions in place:
   1. The server is up.
   2. The server is capable of sending and receiving data.
   3. The client is capable of sending and receiving data to/from the server.
   4. The user is able to interact with the client to format the data and have the data sent and received.
   5. The UI is adjustable to many input formats.
4. Flow:
   1. The use case begins when the user interacts with client UI to input and their data into the formatted conversion calculator.
   2. The user sends the data to the server.
   3. The server processes the data and does the conversion calculation.
   4. The server formats the converted data and sends it back to the client
   5. The client displays the converted data
   6. The use case ends

5. Alternative flow:
   If in step 1 of the basic flow the user could input data that can’t be calculated, then 
   1. There would be an output message saying the input data can’t be calculated and please try a different input
6. Subflows:
Step 1:
User selects the conversion they need to do (length,volume,time,weight)

7. Key Scenarios:
   1. The user interacts with the client UI to input data.
   2. The user interacts with the client UI to send the data.
   3. The client formats the data and sends it to the server.
   4. The server converts the data after the calculation is performed.
   5. The server formats and sends the data back to the client
   6. The client receives the data and displays it on the UI
8. Post-Conditions:
   1. No post conditions
9. Special Requirements:
   1. No special requirements
