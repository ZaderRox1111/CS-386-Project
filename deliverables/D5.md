# Description
QuikMafs is a math calculator that allows users to do many different types of calculations including matrix, conversion, probability, and statistics calculations. QuikMafs system will have a home page where the different buttons will redirect you to the different calculators. For example, if the user chooses to click on the matrix calculator it will bring them to the matrix calculator. QuikMafs utilizes javascript and java swing to do all its operations. QuikMafs is an app that can be downloaded and currently only contains a matrix calculator but will soon include the rest of a calculators as stated above.

Use-Case: User - Conversions
1. The user interacts with the interface to convert numbers from one unit system to another.
2. The only actor present is the user.
3. Preconditions in place:
   1. The server is up.
   2. The server is capable of sending and receiving data.
   3. The client is capable of sending and receiving data to/from the server.
   4. The user is able to interact with the client to format the data and have the data sent and received.
   5. The UI is adjustable to many input formats.
4. Flow:
   1. The use case begins when the user interacts with client UI to input and their data into the formatted conversion calculator.
   2. The user sends the data to the server.
   3. The server processes the data and does the conversion calculation.
   4. The server formats the converted data and sends it back to the client
   5. The client displays the converted data
   6. The use case ends

5. Alternative flow:
   If in step 1 of the basic flow the user could input data that can’t be calculated, then 
   1. There would be an output message saying the input data can’t be calculated and please try a different input
6. Subflows:
Step 1:
User selects the conversion they need to do (length,volume,time,weight)

7. Key Scenarios:
   1. The user interacts with the client UI to input data.
   2. The user interacts with the client UI to send the data.
   3. The client formats the data and sends it to the server.
   4. The server converts the data after the calculation is performed.
   5. The server formats and sends the data back to the client
   6. The client receives the data and displays it on the UI
8. Post-Conditions:
   1. No post conditions
9. Special Requirements:
   1. No special requirements

# Design Patterns
### Behavioral
Method:[Observer Method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/observer-pattern-set-1-introduction/)

![Behavioral Design picture](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project/blob/test/deliverables/D5_BehavioralDesignPicture.png)

Observer method: A new object of MatrixWindow is created in the Console method that needs to be updated 

[Console](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project/blob/test/frontend/Console.java)

[Matrix Window](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project/blob/ca3d02f557cb81a405680764e47b466e85f25a88/frontend/MatrixWindow.java#L10)

### Creational
Method: [Factory Method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-patterns-set-2-factory-method/): Singleton, because there is only one app instantiated ever statically

# Design Principles

[Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project/blob/test/backend/src/app.js): The server is only created once and only sets up the server.

[Open/Closed Principle](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project/blob/test/backend/src/util/matrix.js): AbtsractMatrix class : it allows subclasses to be created from it, but cannot be modified.

[Liskov](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project/blob/test/backend/src/util/matrix.js): RealMatrix class: can replace abstractMatrix classes without altering the functionality.

[Interface](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project/blob/test/frontend/MatrixWindow.java): A new interface is created for every new client instead of using one general purpose interface.

[Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project/blob/test/frontend/Console.java): The server and utilities do not depend on clients to do anything. The client only sends a request and receives the response.
