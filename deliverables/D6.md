# Introduction
QuikMafs is a user-friendly multi purpose calculator that allows college students to easily compute/calculate math problems and understand how they are solved. By having a simple and easy to use UI, it allows students to complete calculations and operations easily. For our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) we design our interface to optimize the user’s experience. For our MVP functionality, we developed the Matrix page with two matrices that can perform various operations such as: addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Once the user selects the operation and inputs the values into the matrices, there is a formatted output matrix. We also implemented a Statistics class that calculates union and intersection probabilities as well as combinations and permutations. Additionally, we added a conversion class length, width, weight and volume. We provided the link to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project
).
