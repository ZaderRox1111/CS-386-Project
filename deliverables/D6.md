# Introduction
QuikMafs is a user-friendly multi purpose calculator that allows college students to easily compute/calculate math problems and understand how they are solved. By having a simple and easy to use UI, it allows students to complete calculations and operations easily. For our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) we design our interface to optimize the userâ€™s experience. For our MVP functionality, we developed the Matrix page with two matrices that can perform various operations such as: addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Once the user selects the operation and inputs the values into the matrices, there is a formatted output matrix. We also implemented a Statistics class that calculates union and intersection probabilities as well as combinations and permutations. Additionally, we added a conversion class length, width, weight and volume. We provided the link to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project
