# Introduction
QuikMafs is a user-friendly multi purpose calculator that allows college students to easily compute/calculate math problems and understand how they are solved. By having a simple and easy to use UI, it allows students to complete calculations and operations easily. For our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) we design our interface to optimize the userâ€™s experience. For our MVP functionality, we developed the Matrix page with one matrix that can calculate Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF). Once the user selects the operation and inputs the values into the matrix, there is a formatted output matrix. We also implemented a Statistics class that calculates union and intersection probabilities as well as combinations and permutations. Additionally, we added a conversion class length, time, mass and volume. We provided the link to our [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project).

# Code Quality 
We used the ESLint rules for the backend like: rules relate to possible logic errors in code, rules suggest alternate ways of doing things, and rules care about how the code looks rather than how it executes. Essentially it made sure that all of the code written in the backend followed the same structure and whitespace rules, making sure our code is easy to follow when moving from different classes.

# Lessons learned 
Our team learned a lot more about how to connect to databases and create optimized calculations - but learned even more about how to work together as a team.

One of the biggest lessons we learned was that creating an initial design and architecture and sticking to it makes it much easier for a team of developers to follow. Having to update class diagrams for a few different changes and updates showed us that it would be beneficial to spend a little extra time at the beginning to create a fleshed out design that we can use as a complete blueprint.
