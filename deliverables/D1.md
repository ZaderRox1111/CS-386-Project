# Introduction
Our software will provide a multi-purpose mathematical tool for users to compute a range of math concepts. Eventually visual elements will be included in order to enhance the user experience and approachability of the interface. The plan is to cover a large range of mathematical concepts and provide step by step solutions to the problems - we plan to start with matrix functions and go from there. We hope that this can be used in school, the workplace and any other applicable locations.
