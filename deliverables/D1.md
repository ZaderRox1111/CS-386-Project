# Introduction

Our software will provide a multi-purpose mathematical tool for users to compute a range of math concepts. Eventually visual elements will be included in order to enhance the user experience and approachability of the interface. The plan is to cover a large range of mathematical concepts and provide step by step solutions to the problems - we plan to start with matrix functions and go from there. We hope that this can be used in school, the workplace and any other applicable locations.

# Interviews

- The first interview I (Zach) had was with my roommate Andrew, who is a Mechanical Engineering major. I interviewed him in between classes on Friday, 2/4/22. Some of the key insights I obtained in this interview was that he uses calculators a lot in his ME classes, especially for the calculations he hasn't done in a while like algebra and calculus. He struggles with those calculations and uses online calculators often, and since he is at university he has Wolfram Alfa and knows how to use it. He said "The hardest math I have to do is calculus and algebra, because I haven't seen it in a while", and the takeaway I got fom our conversation was that a user firendly math app would be 'Nice to have'.
- The second interview I (Zach) had was with a friend in the Software Engineering industry, John. I also interviewed him on Friday after work. Some of the key insights I took away from this interview were that he really never uses online calculators, because he doesn't really need to do math ever anymore. He said with the math he does do, "I can just use my phone calculator since its all easy multiplication and stuff". I asked him about when he was in school a few years ago, and he described using online calculators a lot for all of his math classes, like calculus and linear algebra. In his field, Software Engineering, our calculator would be 'Don't care', but as a student, it would be in between 'Don't care' and 'Nice to have'.
