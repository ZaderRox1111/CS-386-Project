# System Description

Another key requirement for our software is **probability calculation**. Within this requirement, we have designated two general functionalities for all of our classes, as well as two more subclasses. The user can select either an **ncr** or **pcr** calculation (combination and permutation, respectively), input a *total number*, and a *number of items to choose*. The app will then *calculate* the probability, and the UI will display the probability as a decimal value and percent. In either of these cases, the user can also calculate a *union* or *intersection* of probabilities.
