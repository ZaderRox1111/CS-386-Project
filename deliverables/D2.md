# Positioning 

### Problem Statement
| The Problem of | creating a multipurpose user friendly calculator |
|-----|-----|
| Affects | most college students |
|  The Impact of which is | accessability of math tools to college students |  

### Product Position Statement
| For  | college students |
|----|----|
|  Who  | need/want a  |
|   The Product Name  | calculator |
|  That  | is easy to use and user friendly |
|  Unlike | physical calculator or online variants such as WolframAlpha or Symbolab |
|  Our Product   | makes math operations and calculation easy to do. |

### Value Proposition and Consumer Segment

**Value Proposition:** QuikMafs is a user friendly multipurpose calculator which allows college students to easily compute/calcuate math problems and understand how they are solved, by having a simple and easy to use UI, it allows students to complete calculations and operations easily. 

**Consumer Segment:** College students who are taking math/STEM courses that involve calculations.

# Stakeholders

**Users:** 
- College students who are taking math/STEM classes.
- People who use math heavily in the workplace

**Competitors:** 
- Multipurpose calculators: Designed for many different types of calculations, UI generally struggles because it has to adapt.
- Single purpose calculators: Designed for one specific operation/type of operaion. UI is good but only can do on operation.

**Detractors:** Unhappy/unsupported users who are actively promoting other calculators that they see better fit. 

**Developers:** Our team. Designing and developing the products as well as maintaining a server. 

# Functional Requirements 

1. Adaptable UI (different based on calculation)
1. Step-by-step solutions
1. Unit conversions
1. Matrix calculation
1. Derivative/Integrals
1. Statistic Calculation
1. Probability

# Non-functional Requirements 

1. Easy to use/understand
1. Personalizable/Customizable 
1. Accure/Correct answers
1. Quick response/calculation time
1. Free to use

# MVP

Our MVP would consist of a user-friendly UI that can do simple or complex matrix calculations and show the steps behind them.

It can be tested by running unit tests to make sure the outputs/solutions to the problems are correct.
