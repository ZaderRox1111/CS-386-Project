### Value Proposition and Consumer Segment

**Value Proposition:** QuikMafs is a user friendly multipurpose calculator which allows college students to easily compute/calcuate math problems and understand how they are solved, by having a simple and easy to use UI, it allows students to complete calculations and operations easily. 

**Consumer Segment:** College students who are taking math/STEM courses that involve calculations.

# Stakeholders

**Users:** 
- College students who are taking math/STEM classes.
- People who use math heavily in the workplace

**Competitors:** 
- Multipurpose calculators: Designed for many different types of calculations, UI generally struggles because it has to adapt.
- Single purpose calculators: Designed for one specific operation/type of operaion. UI is good but only can do on operation.

**Detractors:** Unhappy/unsupported users who are actively promoting other calculators that they see better fit. 

**Developers:** Our team. Designing and developing the products as well as maintaining a server.

   2. [Unit Testing](https://github.com/ZaderRox1111/CS-386-Project/issues/17)

Gabrielle's user stories:
1. As a user who is a non-math major, I want to be able to do conversions for my math classes so I save time when performing hand conversions for homework. (priority #2, approximately 5 hours)
2. As a user who is a physics major, I want to have single-use calculators, like matrix, integral, derivative, etc., all in the same place so I don't have to look them up each time I need to work on a physics problem. (priority #1, approximately 15 hours)

Dylan's user stories:
1. As a user, I want a easy to use and simple calculator to do many different math algorithms so that it can save me time and help me learn. (priority #2, about 2-3 per math algorithm)
2. As a developer, I want to develop an easy to use calacultor that has a very simple and understandable UI so that user can don't have trouble or any issues using our calculator(priority #1, about 10 hours)

Hayden's user stories
1. As a teacher, I would like to be able to give my students a way to very easily get comfortable with high-level math concepts. For example, if I were teaching Linear Algebra, I would give practice assignments which have the students perform matrix operations, then optionally use this calculator to verify whether they're doing it correctly. Looking up how to do the homework is always preferable to a student doing homework incorrectly without getting immediate feedback. (priority #2, ~1 hour per student per assignment)
2. As a physicist, I frequently work with quantum mechanical operators, which often take the form of matrices. If I had an operator that I planned on applying repeatedly to multple (simpler) quantum states, having a calculator where I could simply change a few parameters and hit "submit" would be incredibly convenient as opposed to doing it all by hand. (priority #2)

Gareth's user stories:
1. As a user who is a STEM major, I want to have an easy to statistics for use during class/homework. (prio #2, 5 hrs)
2. As a developer, I want to develop a calculator in a modular fasion so that way updating/fixing/adding components is relatively easy to do. (prio #1, 2hrs per component)
